# NumberPlate_Detection
Number plate detection with OCR
In this project, I got Sri Lankan number plates and annotated them in Roboflow, then trained those datasets in Google Colab using the Yolo_V5 algorithm and got the train dataset. Using those trained datasets, detect the numberplate and then change those data sets into a text file Using Optical character recognition.
Here i provide you the google colab code also.
